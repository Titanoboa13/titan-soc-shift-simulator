Overview

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) shift workflow, focusing on Tier-1 and Tier-2 alert triage, prioritization, escalation, and shift reporting.

The goal is to replicate how alerts are handled during an active SOC shift:

Incoming alerts are reviewed from a queue

Each alert is classified based on risk and behavior

Decisions are made following SOC operational logic

Escalations and incidents are clearly separated

A shift summary report is generated at the end of the shift

This project is designed to reflect expectations from enterprise SOC environments such as telecom and MSSP operations.

SOC Use Case

The simulator focuses on the following SOC activities:

Tier-1 alert triage and prioritization

Identification of benign, suspicious, and malicious behavior

Escalation decisions based on severity and context

Incident identification requiring immediate response

End-of-shift reporting for operational visibility

The workflow mirrors how SOC analysts process alerts during a live shift under SLA constraints.

Alert Queue Format

Alerts are ingested from a CSV file simulating a SIEM alert queue.

Example fields:

Timestamp

Alert ID

User

Host

Process and parent process

Command line

Severity

Detection rule name

This structure mirrors alerts typically generated by SIEM, EDR, or XDR platforms.

Alert Classification Logic

Alerts are evaluated and categorized into the following SOC outcomes:

Benign
Expected user or system behavior with no malicious indicators.

Monitor
Requires observation or additional context but no immediate escalation.

Escalate
Suspicious activity requiring Tier-2 investigation.

Incident
Confirmed malicious behavior requiring immediate incident response.

Decisions are made using:

Process lineage analysis

Command-line inspection

Severity correlation

Known attacker techniques (e.g., LOLBins, encoded PowerShell)

Output Artifacts
Shift Report

At the end of each run, a shift summary report is generated:

Total alerts processed

Breakdown by classification (Benign / Monitor / Escalate / Incident)

This report simulates what a SOC analyst would hand over during a shift change.

Escalated Alerts

High-risk alerts and confirmed incidents are documented separately, including:

Alert ID

Classification

Required next actions

This reflects real SOC escalation and incident workflows.

Example Output

Shift Summary Report

Benign: 2
Monitor: 1
Escalate: 1
Incident: 1


Escalated Alerts

ALRT-003 - Escalate
High-risk behavior detected. Escalation to Tier-2 required.

ALRT-004 - Incident
Confirmed malicious behavior detected. Immediate incident response required.

Skills Demonstrated

SOC Tier-1 and Tier-2 alert handling

Log and process chain analysis

Incident vs escalation decision-making

Shift-based operational reporting

Practical SOC documentation mindset

Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates not just technical analysis, but operational SOC thinking:

Prioritization under time constraints

Clear documentation

Consistent decision logic

Awareness of real SOC workflows

It is intended to reflect the expectations of enterprise SOC teams in telecom, MSSP, and corporate security environments.

Next Steps

Planned improvements may include:

SLA timing simulation

Analyst notes per alert

SOAR-style automated response actions

MITRE ATT&CK tagging per alert
